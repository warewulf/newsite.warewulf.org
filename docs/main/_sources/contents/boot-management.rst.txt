Boot Management
===============

Warewulf uses iPXE to for network boot by default. As a tech preview, support
for GRUB is also available, which adds support for secure boot.

Booting with iPXE
=================

.. graphviz::

  digraph G{
      node [shape=box];
      compound=true;
      edge [label2node=true]
      bios [shape=record label="{BIOS | boots from DHCP/next-server via TFTP}"]

      subgraph cluster0 {
       label="iPXE boot"
       iPXE;
       ipxe_cfg [shape=record label="{ipxe.cfg|generated for each node}"];
       iPXE -> ipxe_cfg [label="http"];
      }

      bios->iPXE [lhead=cluster0,label="iPXE.efi"];

      kernel [shape=record label="{kernel|ramdisk (root fs)|wwinit overlay}|extracted from node container"];
      ipxe_cfg->kernel[ltail=cluster0,label="http"];
  }

Booting with GRUB
=================

Support for GRUB as a network bootloader (replacing iPXE) is available in
Warewulf as a technology preview.

.. graphviz::

  digraph G{
      node [shape=box];
      compound=true;
      edge [label2node=true]
      bios [shape=record label="{BIOS | boots from DHCP/next-server via TFTP}"]

      bios->shim [lhead=cluster1,label="shim.efi"];
      subgraph cluster1{
        label="Grub boot"
        shim[shape=record label="{shim.efi|from ww4 host}"];
        grub[shape=record label="{grubx64.efi | name hardcoded in shim.efi|from ww4 host}"]
        shim->grub[label="TFTP"];
        grubcfg[shape=record label="{grub.cfg|static under TFTP root}"];
        grub->grubcfg[label="TFTP"];
      }
      kernel [shape=record label="{kernel|ramdisk (root fs)|wwinit overlay}|extracted from node container"];
      grubcfg->kernel[ltail=cluster1,label="http"];
  }

Instead of the iPXE starter a combination of `shim and GRUB
<https://www.suse.com/c/uefi-secure-boot-details/>`_ can be used with the
advantage that secure boot can be used. That means that only the signed kernel
of a distribution can be booted. This can be a huge security benefit for some
scenarios.

In order to enable the grub boot method it has to be enabled in `warewulf.conf`.

.. code-block: yaml

   warewulf:
     grubboot: true

Nodes which are not known to Warewulf are booted with the shim/grub from the
Warewulf server host.

Secure boot
-----------

.. graphviz::

   digraph foo {
      node [shape=box];
      subgraph boot {
        "EFI" [label="EFI",row=boot];
        "Shim" [label="Shim",row=boot];
        "Grub" [label="Grub",row=boot];
        "Kernel" [label="kernel",row=boot];
        EFI -> Shim[label="Check for Microsoft signature"];
        Shim -> Grub[label="Check for Distribution signature"];
        Grub->Kernel[label="Check for Distribution or MOK signature"];
      }
    }

If secure boot is enabled at every step a signature is checked and the boot
process fails if this check fails. The shim typically only includes the key for
a single operating system, which means that each distribution needs separate
`shim` and `grub` executables. Warewulf extracts these binaries from the
containers. If the node is unknown to Warewulf or can't be identified during
the TFTP boot phase, the shim/grub binaries of the host in which Warewulf is
running are used.

Install shim and efi
--------------------

`shim.efi` and `grub.efi` must be installed in the container for it to be
booted by GRUB.

.. code-block:: console

  # wwctl container shell leap15.5 
  [leap15.5] Warewulf> zypper install grub2 shim

  # wwctl container shell rocky9
  [rocky9] Warewulf> dnf install shim-x64.x86_64 grub2-efi-x64.x86_64

These packages must also be installed on the Warewulf server host to enable
node discovery using GRUB.

http boot
---------

Modern EFI systems have the possibility to directly boot per http. The flow diagram
is the following:

.. graphviz::

  digraph G{
      node [shape=box];
      efi [shape=record label="{EFI|boots from URI defined in filename}"];
      shim [shape=record label="{shim.efi|replaces shim.efi with grubx64.efi in URI|extracted from node container}"];
      grub [shape=record label="{grub.efi|checks for grub.cfg|extracted from node container}"]
      kernel [shape=record label="{kernel|ramdisk (root fs)|wwinit overlay}|extracted from node container"];
      efi->shim [label="http"];
      shim->grub [label="http"];
      grub->kernel [label="http"];
    }

Warewulf delivers the initial `shim.efi` and `grub.efi` via http as taken
directly from the node's assigned container.
