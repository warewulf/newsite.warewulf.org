Documentation
=============

We (like almost all open source software providers) have a
documentation dilemmaâ€¦ We tend to focus on the code features and
functionality before working on documentation. And there is very good
reason for this: we want to share the love so nobody feels left out!

You can contribute to the documentation by `raising an issue to
suggest an improvement
<https://github.com/hpcng/warewulf-web/issues/new>`_ or by sending a
`pull request <https://github.com/hpcng/warewulf-web/compare>`_ on
`our repository <https://github.com/hpcng/warewulf-web>`_.

The current documentation is generated with `Docusaurus
<https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/>`_.

For more information on using Git and GitHub to create a pull request
suggesting additions and edits to the docs, see the `section on
contributing to the code <contributing>`_. The procedure is identical
for contributions to the documentation and the code base.
