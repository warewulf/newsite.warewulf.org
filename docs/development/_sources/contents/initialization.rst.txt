Warewulf Initialization
=======================

System Services
===============

Once Warewulf has been installed and configured, it is ready to be
initialized and have the associated system services started. To do
this, start by configuring the system services that Warewulf depends
on for operation. To do that, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl configure --all

This command will configure the system for Warewulf to run
properly. Here are the things it will do:

* **dhcp**: (re)Write the DHCP configuration and restart the service
  from the **host** template under ``/etc/dhcpd.conf.ww`` and enable
  the system service.
* **hostfile**: Update the system's /etc/hosts file based on the
  **host** template ``/etc/hosts.ww``.
* **nfs**: Configure the NFS server on the control node as well as the
  ``/etc/fstab`` in the system overlay based on the configuration in
  ``/etc/warewulf/warewulf.conf`` and enable the system service. Also
  the file ``/etc/exports.ww`` from the **host** template is installed.
* **ssh**: Create the appropriate host keys (stored in
  ``/etc/warewulf/keys/``) and user keys for passwordless ``ssh`` into
  the nodes. Addionally the shell profiles
  ``/etc/profile.d/ssh_setup.csh`` and ``/etc/profile.d/ssh_setup.sh``
  are installed.
* **tftp**: Write the appropriate binary PXE/iPXE blobs to the TFTP
  root directory and enable the system service.

This command will quickly setup the system services per the Warewulf
configuration. Watch this output carefully for errors and resolve them
in the configuration portion of this manual.

Warewulf Service
================

The Warewulf installation attempts to register the Warewulf service
with Systemd, so it should be as easy to start/stop/check as any other
Systemd service:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl enable --now warewulfd

You can also check and control the Warewulf service using the ``wwctl``
command line program as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl server status

.. note::

   If the Warewulf service is running via Systemd, restarting
   stopping, and starting it from the ``wwctl`` command may result in
   unexpected results.

Logs
----

The Warewulf server logs are by default written to
``/var/log/warewulfd.log``.
